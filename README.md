# Distcount

This project is a demonstration of come of the principles of the mapreduce paradigm



### Libs and languages
We use `scala` to give us precise language to label all the moving parts and make sense of the complexity 
We make use of the `cats` and `fs2` libraries to give us good primitives 


### What will I learn?
- See how the distributed mapreduce paradigm can help improve throughput 
  - See throughput in action via statsd 


A statsD/carbon and grafana server are started to collect metrics
